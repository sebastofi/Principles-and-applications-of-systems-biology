# Project in Principles-and-applications-of-systems-biology

Aim: present the GECKO method by illustrating results from figures 3-6 produduced by the authors of the article ['Improving the phenotype predictions of a yeast genome-scale metabolic model by incorporating enzymatic constraints'.](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20167411)

Method: Use of matTFA, GECKO v3. [source](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO), [Gecko v1.0](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/releases/tag/v1.0)
Note: Since the authors wrote the paper in 2017, GECKO was upgraded from GECKO v1, and the yeast model updated from v7 to v8, which we took into consideration when recreating the figures.
- Creating the ecModels and integrating the proteomics data by the procedure described in the auathor's repo in the file ['protocols'](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/tree/main/tutorials/full_ecModel)
